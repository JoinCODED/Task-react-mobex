# TASK-NAME

This is the template for tasks. These repos are the starting points and instructions for students to explore a concept.

## Instructions

Add instructions here. This is github flavoured markdown so you can be as creative as you want. Add code snippets, images, gifs, checkboxes, anything you want.

### 1. Extract Components

- [ ] Look at the html in `index.html`
- [ ] Move it into `App.js`
- [ ] Do you see those cards? Can you turn them into a component??

It should look like this:

### 2. Do the thing

Explanation of the thing and why we're about to do it. Cool right?

- [ ] Make a `store.js` file
- [ ] Copy + Paste broken code:  
  ```js
  console.log("lol");
  ```
- [ ] Have an explanation ready for when Zainab interrogates you
